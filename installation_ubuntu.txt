sudo apt update
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ansible
ansible --version

cd .ssh
vi authorized_keys
copy the public key id_rsa.pub content from the controller and copy it inside authorized_keys

vi /etc/ansible/hosts
[myhosts]

ansible --inventory /etc/ansible/hosts myhosts -m ping
ansible all -m ping
ansible all --list-hosts
ansible all -m shell -a "ls -altr" //list all files on hosts
ansible myhosts[1] -m shell -a "touch newfile" // create file in server at 1st index
ansible all -m shell -a "apt install git" //permission denied since no sudo used
ansible all -m shell -a "sudo apt install git" //will work since we have used sudo
ansible all -m shell -a "apt install git" -b //will work since we have used -b ie become sudo
ansible all -m copy -a "src=hellofile dest=/home/sysops"
ansible all -m apt -a "name=apache2 state=present" -b
ansible all -m service -a "name=apache2 state=stopped" -b
